# WikiCrawler
Respository for the HARP151 Group Project with Kaitlyn Matthews,  Russell Whitefield, Dion Cenalia, Nashara Marrow, Preston Muirhead, Samuel Ramos (Fall 2022)

We want to create a research tool that can gamify research and can map out topics of interest in an interesting way. 

The prototype we are working on this semester would specifically allow you to explore wikipedia like one would a pixelated dungeon crawler. Here is the interaction we are trying to create:

At the start menu, a user would type in the url of an article
The program would visualize that article in the form of a room 
All of the links in the article would be represented as doors to other rooms
The player would be able to move an avatar to other rooms, and therefore navigate through articles like one would a dungeon crawler. 
	
There are variations of this idea. In one variation, the user navigates between articles by using keywords. 

And in another variation, we would have a different way to visualize the navigation. Instead of the avatar navigating through rooms, the user would control a ball that would move along a weblike structure, with the intersections of the web being the actual articles.
